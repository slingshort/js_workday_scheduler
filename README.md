# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Aim

The aim was to try and create a workday scheduler in which users could input events into hourly time slots which would save to local storage and remain on the page despite refresh

## Struggles/Things to fix and improve

- Figure out at way to change add classes/better manipulate innerHTML in JavsScipt based on a certain set of conditions, and use this along with momentJS to manipuate the classes of HTML elements. The aim was to change the background colour of timblocks based on the time

- Better way to use Jquery to trim down the code and run it more efficiently.

## Functionality
- User input events are successfully saved to Local storage with appropriate keys, they are then successfully recalled despite page refresh
- A confim alert appears at the top of the schedule during a save event. Then the alert disappears after 1 sec
- Save button behaves appropriately upon hover and click events
